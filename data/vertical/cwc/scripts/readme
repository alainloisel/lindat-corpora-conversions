This scripts are for parsing the corpus CWC and converting into vertical format.
As the corpus is huge, it needs to be splitted into many documents and then parsed.
Scripts are adopted from some of Ondra Dusek code for parsing CNC.

Makefile - for compilation of a parsed and transformed corpus (gets it directly from output folder)

Makefile_parsetreex - old file for parsing on cluster, needs to be adopted for troja

split_to_dirs.pl - splits corpus into smaller chunks
