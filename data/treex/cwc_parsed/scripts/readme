CWC is a huge corpus (over 38 mlrd sentences) automatically downloaded from web
in a vertical format. The corpus is parsed and compiled like this:

1. concat.py   - concatenated into sentences
2. ssh to a machine with treex installed, mv Makefile_parsetreex Makefile; make split; make parse; make concatenate, put the result file into output folder on kontext-dev.
3. make  - compile the output

The block Write::Manatee will be adjusted according to which attributes we want
to include into the corpus.
