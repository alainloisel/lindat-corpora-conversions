Czech-Russian-English UMC corpus comes from https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11858/00-097C-0000-0001-4909-7
or http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/umc/cer/ . 
Now we have two instances of this tri-parallel corpus in KonText: Czech-Russian and English-Russian (providing we have quite a few Czech-English corpora). We used only one-to-one alignment for bothe pairs, so parsing and aligning
parsed corpus should not be a big problem.
Unfortunately, the corpus is bi-aligned, not tri-aligned, so we can not put it into KonText as tri-parallel corpus.
