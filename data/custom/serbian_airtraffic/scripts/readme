The corpus is artificially created one - a native speaker of Serbian reads the 
messages from ATC used by plane pilots.

The corpus is annotated with pitch-marks(glottal closure instance), but imho
there is no way to process such small phonetic units within manatee.
For the first version I will use word-level annotation only. Later on, we can consult
with the authors if those pitch-marks are really needed to be present and in which form. The same applies to alignment.mlf - sound search?
